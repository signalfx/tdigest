This tool generates CSV files for various statistical analyses of the t-digest's behavior. They are similar to the CSVs generated by Dunning's own tests [here](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/src/test/java/com/tdunning/math/stats/TDigestTest.java). To use:

```
go build .
./analysis [<rounds> [<samples> [<seed>]]]
```

This will populate a t-digest with `samples` samples in it, drawn from a uniform distribution seeded by `seed`, and then dump statistical information about the t-digest to various CSV files. It will repeat this process `rounds` times for the uniform distribution, and then another `rounds` times for a normal distribution, and then another `rounds` times for an exponential distribution. The default values will run 10 rounds with 100,000 samples each, using a seed from the current time. This behavior is equivalent to Dunning's original tests.

An R script has been included to draw various graphs from the data. It depends on `data.table` and `ggplot2`. Note that, depending on the size of the ata, it can take upwards of 10 minutes for this script to finish.
